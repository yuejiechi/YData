The only **\"work\"** on this homework is to run all the cells in this notebook. If the Python environment is working, you should not see any error messages as you run the cells below. If you do encounter error messages, please try to debug by going to office hours and asking on Ed Discussion.\n",

However, to start with, with strongly recommend you use the YCRC Jupyter Notebook server, and later in the semester we can discuss other Jupyter notebook options. \n"
